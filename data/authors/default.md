I'm currently part of the Google Distributed Cloud Air-Gapped team, where I'm excited to take on new and complex challenges. Prior to joining Google, I acquired over 2 years of hands-on experience as a Software Development Engineer at Media.net, building a solid foundation in software development.

My journey in tech started with a Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from IIIT Hyderabad where I developed my technological abilities as well as established an interest for development. During my college days, I also had the opportunity to work on research internships at Samsung Research Institute and IIST Trivandrum.

I am passionate about using technology to make a difference; due to this fact, I am very eager to be part of more projects that can impact the continuously growing tech industry.
